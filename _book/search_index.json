Correlations range between -1.0 and 1.0, with darker red indicating a strong positive correlation, blue indicating a strong negative correlation, and lighter shades (towards white) indicating weaker or no correlation. ggplot(data = melted_cormat, aes(x = Var1, y = Var2)) + geom_tile(aes(fill = value), color = &quot;white&quot;) + scale_fill_gradient2(low = &quot;blue&quot;, high = &quot;red&quot;, mid = &quot;white&quot;, midpoint = 0, limit = c(-1, 1), space = &quot;Lab&quot;, name = &quot;Correlation&quot;) + theme_minimal() + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, size = 12, hjust = 1), axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12)) + coord_fixed() 3.2 Correlation Matrix A strong positive correlation between height and defensive rebound percentage as well as offensive rebound percentage. Weight also shows positive correlations with both rebound percentage, though slightly weaker compared to height. Height seems to have a negative correlation with assist percentage, suggesting taller players might assist less. Other metrics like true shooting percentage and usage percentage have weaker correlations with height and weight. 3.3 Correlation Between H/W and R/A Four scatter plots depict the relationships between player height, player weight, rebounds, and assists. height_reb &lt;- ggplot(nba, aes(x = player_height, y = reb)) height_reb &lt;- height_reb + geom_point() height_ast &lt;- ggplot(nba, aes(x = player_height, y = ast)) height_ast &lt;- height_ast + geom_point() weight_reb &lt;- ggplot(nba, aes(x = player_weight, y = reb)) weight_reb &lt;- weight_reb + geom_point() weight_ast &lt;- ggplot(nba, aes(x = player_weight, y = ast)) weight_ast &lt;- weight_ast + geom_point() grid.arrange(height_reb + geom_smooth(), height_ast + geom_smooth(), weight_reb + geom_smooth(), weight_ast + geom_smooth(), ncol = 2) ## `geom_smooth()` using method = &#39;gam&#39; and formula = &#39;y ~ s(x, bs = &quot;cs&quot;)&#39; ## `geom_smooth()` using method = &#39;gam&#39; and formula = &#39;y ~ s(x, bs = &quot;cs&quot;)&#39; ## `geom_smooth()` using method = &#39;gam&#39; and formula = &#39;y ~ s(x, bs = &quot;cs&quot;)&#39; ## `geom_smooth()` using method = &#39;gam&#39; and formula = &#39;y ~ s(x, bs = &quot;cs&quot;)&#39; 3.4 Summary From Scatter Plots Consistent with the correlation matrix, height and rebound idsplays an upward trend, indicating that taller players tend to have more rebounds. Conversely, height and assist depicts a downward trend, signifying that shorter players usually have more assists. 3.5 Net Rating By Player’s Physical Attributes The boxplots depict the distribution of net rating (i.e., the team’s point differential per 100 possessions while a player is on court) across various player heights and weights. heightdatapart &lt;- data.frame(player_height = nba$player_height, net_rating = nba$net_rating) heightdatapart &lt;- heightdatapart[(heightdatapart$net_rating &gt;= -50 &amp; heightdatapart$net_rating &lt;= 50), ] heightdatapart$group &lt;- cut(heightdatapart$player_height, breaks = 7) ph &lt;- ggplot(data = heightdatapart, aes(x = group, y = net_rating, fill = group)) + geom_boxplot() + ggtitle(&quot;Net Rating by Player Height&quot;) + theme_minimal() print(ph) weightdatapart &lt;- data.frame(player_weight = nba$player_weight, net_rating = nba$net_rating) weightdatapart &lt;- weightdatapart[(weightdatapart$net_rating &gt;= -50 &amp; weightdatapart$net_rating &lt;= 50), ] weightdatapart$group &lt;- cut(weightdatapart$player_weight, breaks = 7) pw &lt;- ggplot(data = weightdatapart, aes(x = group, y = net_rating, fill = group)) + geom_boxplot() + ggtitle(&quot;Net Rating by Player Weight&quot;) + theme_minimal() print(pw) 3.6 Summary From Box Plot 3.6.1 Net Rating by Player Height Players in the height range of 190 cm to 203 cm tend to have a wider variation in net rating, with some players in this range even having exceptionally high net ratings. Taller players, especially those between 206 cm and 211 cm, have a slightly lower median net rating. The shorter players, particularly those below 188 cm, also show a lower median net rating, but with less variability than the taller players. Players who are 213 cm and above exhibit a narrower interquartile range (middle 50% of data) but with a few outliers having lower net ratings. 3.6.2 Net Rating by Player Weight Players weighing between 70-85 kg and 100-115 kg display a wider range in net rating, with some outliers, particularly on the higher end. Players in the weight range of 85-100 kg have a median net rating that’s slightly higher, with a more compact interquartile range, indicating less variability in their performance. Heavier players, weighing 119 kg and above, exhibit a narrower interquartile range with a few lower outliers. From the boxplots, it can be concluded that: 3.6.3 General Summary Players of medium height (190 cm to 203 cm) tend to have varied performances, with some players being exceptionally good based on net rating. The shortest and the tallest players tend to have a slightly lower median net rating. Players of medium weight (85-100 kg) generally have consistent performances, while players on the lighter and heavier ends show greater variability in net rating.

H1: Versatility &amp; Position-less Basketball Given the narrow range of heights and weights and the varied performance of players irrespective of their physical attributes, it does hint towards the emergence of “position-less” basketball. Players are breaking traditional molds, and their skills are no longer just confined to their height and weight. H2: Evolution in Playing Style The NBA’s pace and style have evolved, favoring versatile players over traditional roles. The varied performances of players, especially the medium-height ones, and the shift from a strong center-focused game further supports this hypothesis. p1 &lt;- ggplot(nba, aes(x = player_weight, y = player_height)) p1 &lt;- p1 + geom_point() p1 + geom_smooth() ## `geom_smooth()` using method = &#39;gam&#39; and formula = &#39;y ~ s(x, bs = &quot;cs&quot;)&#39; 4.2 Time-series Visualization To further explore H1 and H2, a time-series analysis portraying the fluctuating correlation between height and weight over seasons has been drawn. p &lt;- ggplot(cor_df, aes(x = season, y = correlation, group = 1)) + geom_line() + xlab(&quot;Season&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Correlation between Height and Weight&quot;) + ggtitle(&quot;Correlation between Height and Weight over Seasons&quot;) + theme_minimal() print(p) 4.3 Summary From 4.2 A significant higher correlation between height and weight can be observed between season 1996-97 and 2009-10, suggesting a stronger relationship between a player’s height and weight. This could have been due to the prevalence of taditional roles and the center-focused game styles, if we recall who were the most dominant players at that time (e.g., Shaquille O’Neal, Hakeem Olajuwon, Tim Duncan, Karl Malone, Dirk Nowitzki, Kevin Garnett) Since the season 2009-10 , the correlation dips, suggesting a weaker relationship between height and weight. This potentially supports the hypothesis of “position-less” basketball becoming more prevalent, as players’ roles become less defined by their physical attributes. "],["clustering.html", "5 Clustering 5.1 k-means Clustering Of Players 5.2 Summary From the Clustering 5.3 Hierachical Clustering", " 5 Clustering 5.1 k-means Clustering Of Players To further investigate the transition in playing style and the trend toward position-less basketball, clustering analysis were conducted. This analysis used selected features including player height, weight, rebounds, assists, net rating, offensive rebounds, defensive rebounds, usage percentage, true shooting percentage, and assist percentage. What Data Was Included Given that more than 200 players participate in each NBA season and audiences generally remember high-scoring players, I applied specific criteria for more clear and understandable visualization results. For the selected seasons, only players who participated in more than 50 games and had an average score exceeding 10 points were included in the analysis. Selected Season Based on the visualization in Section 4.2, a stronger correlation between height and weight (H/W) is evident between the seasons 1996-97 and 2009-10. This suggests a traditional, center-focused playing style, with a peak occurring in the 2000-01 season. To examine how player performance styles were clustered during periods when traditional styles dominated, we selected the 2000-01 and 2009-10 seasons. NBA fans commonly believe that the “small-ball center” and “three-point trend” popularized by Stephen Curry’s Golden State Warriors from 2015 to 2019 were catalysts for the transition in playing styles. To explore how player performance styles have evolved in more recent years, I selected the 2015-16 season and the most current season, 2022-2023. nba_selected_season &lt;- nba[(which(nba$season == &quot;2022-23&quot;)), ] nba_selected_season &lt;- nba_selected_season[nba_selected_season$pts &gt; 10, ] nba_selected_season &lt;- nba_selected_season[nba_selected_season$gp &gt; 50, ] rownames(nba_selected_season) &lt;- nba_selected_season$player_name selected_features &lt;- c(&quot;player_height&quot;, &quot;pts&quot;, &quot;player_weight&quot;, &quot;reb&quot;, &quot;ast&quot;, &quot;net_rating&quot;, &quot;oreb_pct&quot;, &quot;dreb_pct&quot;, &quot;usg_pct&quot;, &quot;ts_pct&quot;, &quot;ast_pct&quot;) nba_for_clustering &lt;- nba_selected_season %&gt;% select(all_of(selected_features)) df &lt;- as.data.frame(scale(nba_for_clustering)) fviz_nbclust(df, kmeans, method = &quot;wss&quot;) + geom_vline(xintercept = 7, linetype = 2) set.seed(123) km_result &lt;- kmeans(df, centers = 7) clustering_23 &lt;- fviz_cluster(km_result, data = df, ellipse.type = &quot;euclid&quot;, ellipse.level = 0.5, ellipse.ratio = 0.8, star.plot = TRUE, repel = TRUE, main = &quot;NBA 2022-2023&quot;, ggtheme = theme_minimal()) clustering_23 &lt;- clustering_23 + theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 30, face = &quot;italic&quot;, color = &quot;blue&quot;, hjust = 0.5, vjust = 1, angle = 0, lineheight = 1.2)) For season 2000-01 print(clustering_01) kable(mean_values_01) cluster player_height player_weight pts reb ast 1 200.3213 97.58276 23.06667 5.740000 4.360000 2 209.9733 116.49755 24.00000 11.300000 3.750000 3 209.4089 110.37405 14.03889 8.505556 1.650000 4 186.7568 84.94107 15.83158 3.736842 6.742105 5 198.7296 96.77839 13.65200 3.984000 2.472000 6 204.6705 107.38194 14.04211 6.105263 1.921053 7 191.5160 88.63188 16.12000 4.440000 6.420000 For season 2009-10 print(clustering_10) kable(mean_values_10) cluster player_height player_weight pts reb ast 1 192.5320 92.16989 17.78000 4.920000 9.800000 2 210.0792 117.59373 16.15000 9.754167 1.991667 3 187.4253 84.94107 14.20526 2.705263 4.673684 4 195.1789 93.79805 19.55789 4.378947 5.252632 5 206.3262 106.50689 15.16923 5.715385 1.834615 6 193.9471 91.36639 13.10714 2.964286 2.650000 7 205.5446 107.67576 14.13462 6.519231 2.338462 For season 2015-16 print(clustering_16) kable(mean_values_16) cluster player_height player_weight pts reb ast 1 189.7592 88.50714 17.87917 4.016667 6.491667 2 209.5500 114.50930 16.73000 8.585000 2.370000 3 191.5459 87.30312 13.50000 3.147059 3.817647 4 196.7593 94.16894 14.13929 3.557143 2.671429 5 211.0509 114.71754 13.36364 10.263636 1.145455 6 206.3262 104.76231 13.67692 5.723077 1.788461 7 201.0229 102.05820 23.42857 6.871429 4.957143 For season 2022-23 print(clustering_23) kable(mean_values_23) cluster player_height player_weight pts reb ast 1 211.3280 113.25285 15.90000 9.196000 2.352000 2 197.4615 97.10229 13.09259 3.555556 1.855556 3 206.6925 112.09392 28.67500 9.662500 6.125000 4 189.2300 88.18241 13.73182 3.427273 5.009091 5 201.2462 98.91795 14.81154 4.538462 2.276923 6 193.2609 92.27639 24.90000 4.917391 6.239130 7 195.5800 92.41340 18.14737 4.826316 4.700000 5.2 Summary From the Clustering H1 Versatility &amp; Position-less Basketball 2000-01 Season: players are more dispersed, suggesting a distinct division between positions based on physical attributes like height and weight. For example: Traditional Centers: players around 7 feet tall and weighing between 250-300 lbs are prominent. These athletes typically represent traditional centers prevalent during this era (e.g., Tim Duncan, Karl Malone, Kevin Garnett, Dirk Nowitzki, Chris Webber, Shaquille O’Neal). Guards: athletes with heights ranging from 6’3” to 6’6” and weights between 180-210 lbs form distinct clusters, representing the roles of shooting and point guards. 2009-10 Season: despite the strong correlation between height and weight suggested by Visualization 4.2, players like LeBron James and Dwyane Wade begin to lead the trend toward a more versatile playing style. LeBron James, for instance, while physically dominant enough to be considered a small forward, also demonstrates the skills and agility typical of guards. He can be grouped with well-known point guards like Steve Nash, Rajon Rondo, and Jason Kidd. On the other hand, players like Russell Westbrook, originally considered point guards, start taking on more scoring roles, leading them to be identified with scorers like Kobe Bryant and Carmelo Anthony. The diverse physical attributes within this scoring cluster make the transitional trend more apparent. 2015-16 Season: clusters start to merge, indicating the onset of the “position-less” trend. Players of various physical attributes now perform roles previously confined to specific positions. Draymond Green (6’6”, 230 lbs), for example, plays effectively as a point guard, power forward, and even center despite having the height of a traditional small forward. Additionally, dominant forwards who aren’t traditional big men or guards but possess qualities of both are increasingly playing central roles (e.g., LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard). 2022-23 Season: clusters continue to converge, showcasing increasing versatility among players. Athletes with a narrow height range of 6’5” to 6’10” and weight range of 210-250 lbs are now playing multiple roles on the court—whether it’s shooting, ball-handling, or post plays. Players like Luka Dončić, Giannis Antetokounmpo, LeBron James, and Nikola Jokić can be grouped in the same cluster, despite their varying physical sizes. H2 Evolution in Playing Style 2000-01 and 2009-10 Seasons: the dominance of players like Shaquille O’Neal and Tim Duncan indicates a game focused on the post and interior play, supporting the traditional center-focused style. At the same time, players like Kobe Bryant and Vince Carter, typically shooting guards, with a height-weight specification of around 6’6” and 212 lbs, show the traditional divisions in playing roles. 2015-16 Season: with players like Stephen Curry and LeBron James leading the clusters from 2010 to 2020, it’s evident that the style has evolved to prioritize agility, shooting range, and versatility.

Centers like Shaquille O’Neal exemplified this trend with their dominance in the post. However, with the progression second ten year, there’s a marked shift towards position-less basketball. Players like Stephen Curry, LeBron James, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokić exemplify this evolution. Initially known for his scoring, LeBron’s game matured to include playmaking, passing, and even post play, adapting to the requirements of his team and the evolving nature of the NBA. This has paved the way for players who, regardless of their size, can perform multiple roles on the court. 6.2 Evolution in Playing Style The NBA has transitioned from a center-focused play to a more perimeter-oriented game. This shift is evident when comparing the dominance of traditional centers in earlier seasons to the sharpshooting prowess of guards like Stephen Curry in later ones. The league has gravitated towards faster-paced, space-oriented offenses, capitalizing on three-point shots and versatile player skills. 6.3 Potential Future Trends The increasing value of versatility suggests the NBA will continue to evolve towards an even faster, more skill-oriented game. Traditional roles might further blur, leading to players being valued more for their overall skill set rather than specific positional attributes. As for physical attributes, while height will always be advantageous, it might not be the dominant factor in player evaluation. Agility, endurance, and skill versatility could become primary attributes scouts look for. For instance, players who, like LeBron, can adapt and reinvent their game will be highly prized. As teams prioritize speed and versatility, we may see an even more diverse range of player heights and weights, with an emphasis on adaptability both in play style and physical conditioning.
